      Biography: <br />SINAI PARK I'm a Computer Programmer, from a unique
      background. I am South Korean by birth, Chinese by upbringing, and
      American by education. My interests lie in the art of user interface and
      user experience, as well as the ability to handle data and facilitate an
      easier life for all users and people in the world. I seek to further
      growth inside of me and to learn forever with the help of mentors,
      teachers, mentees, and God.
